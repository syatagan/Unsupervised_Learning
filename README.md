<h1>Business Problem</h1>
The Firm plans to segment customers and determine marketing strategies based on these segments.To achieve this, customer behaviors will be defined, and groups will be created based on the clustering of these behaviors.
<h1>Data Story</h1>
The dataset consists of information obtained from the past shopping behaviors of customers who made their most recent purchases from FLO in the years 2020-2021. These customers have shopped using the OmniChannel approach, meaning they have made both online and offline purchases.
<h4>Feature List</h4>

<h1>Project Tasks</h1>
<h2>Task 1 : Data Preprocessing</h2>
Step 1: Read the 'flo_data_20K.csv' data.</br>
Step 2: Select the variables that you will use to segment customers. Note that you can create new variables like Tenure (customer's age) and Recency (how many days ago the customer last shopped) to aid in segmentation.</br>
<h2>Task 2 : Customer Segmentation with K-Means </h2>
Step 1: Standardize the variables.</br>
Step 2: Determine the optimal number of clusters.</br>
Step 3: Build your model and segment your customers.</br>
Step 4: Statistically analyze each segment.</br>
<h2>Task 3 : Customer Segmentation with Hierarchical Clustering</h2>
Step 1: Using the dataframe that you standardized in Task 2, determine the optimal number of clusters.</br>
Step 2: Create your model and segment your customers.</br>
Step 3: Statistically analyze each segment.
